Connect 4 perfected! (Kinda.) This program is brought to you by Kyle, Esther, and Freddie. It's got all you could ever want in a Connect 4 game, such as setUpBoard, stateString, checkForWin/checkforDraw, and other fun and wacky functions for the basic rules and moves of Connect 4. In addition to this, the programmers have taken it upon themselves to include an AI who plays in an order that at the very least is not random! The AI evaluates the board to find empty spaces with higher point asssignments, then places a piece depending on which open spot has the highest point allocation. The future of Connect 4 is now!
